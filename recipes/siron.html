    <h2>Siron: Pontian, Kurdish or Turkish?</h2>
    <p>
        So-called Siron; a quite fat and delicious dish from Anatolia.
        You can hear various recipes which are quite similar 
        from Northerns or Easterns or Southerns of Turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's commonly known as a Pontian 
        (Greeks who had lived in the north part of Turkey alongside of Black Sea until 20th century) dish
            but you can find a different recipe of this dish from south of Turkey. It is a version without meat and Kurdish people claim it's their food. (Crossed your mind that Kurdish people might be vegeterian, right? <strong>Well, of course not!</strong>)
    </p>
    <p>
        Their claim gets interesting where they explain the name of dish
        referring their language: Kurdish. It's actually called <em>serun</em>, literally means 'three'(<em>se</em>) 'fat'(<em>run</em>); basically represents 3 fat ingredients: butter, yogurt and butter on the top.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turkish people from the Eastern part of Turkey claim that this is a Turkish food whatever the history of it is.
        They've been eating it for centuries so...
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, I will share the least common recipe of <em>siron</em>: without meat. Enjoy it!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients (for 3-4 people)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 sheets of <em>yufka</em> (Turkish pastry sheets) or you can use fillo pastry instead
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups of beef broth, you can make it by boiling 2.5 cups of water with 1 beef bouillon
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cloves of garlic, crushed
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups of plain yogurt, whipped
        </li>
        <li>
            A pinch of salt
        </li>
        <li>
            50g butter
        </li>
        <li>
            A pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
            A pinch of sumac (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
            A pinch of dried mint flakes or chopped fresh mint leaves (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Once you find the ingredients, making <em>siron</em> is pretty easy. Homemade <em>yufka</em> would be even better if you are skillful and courageous enough take the challenge. The amount of the ingredients is for a 25-30 cm round shallow baking tray.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Cut each pastry sheet into halves and roll them as tightly as possible before cutting up those rolls into 1-inch discs. Place the discs into the tray, again see the picture below. Meanwhile don’t forget to prepare the broth and set aside to cool off, it needs to be at room-temperature when the discs are ready to be moistened.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Mix yogurt, garlic and salt thoroughly. Put aside.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Bake <em>siron</em> at 200 degrees Celsius for 25-30 minutes, till the discs brown up nicely.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven. Spoon all of the broth over the discs slowly.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a pan. Add red pepper if you like. When it’s frothy it’s ready.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Take 10-12 discs into a serving plate, top it up with yogurt sauce, pour 1 tablespoon of butter onto the dish and serve immediately with sumac and/or mint.
        </li>
    </ol>
