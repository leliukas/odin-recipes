Hello Aliens and future me, this is my first website which is a trash. I hope this will be the ugliest one ever.

I started learning 'codingy' things 2 weeks ago, so I have only basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, a knowledge of 10 or 12 days.

I have had difficulties about applying things from .css to subpages and sometimes to index.html itself.

So future me, welcome back. Please change this shitty website but still let it be your worst website.

Konicihiwa Ninja. -or something like that
